# vcardImageQr

**Reason for Development :** 
When I was at the end of high school, I was doing an internship for school and I was working in an advertising agency and they asked me to write a system that automatically saves the person to the phone directory when the qr code is read for their customers' cards. After a little research, I learned how to write vcard data to qrcode and developed the project.

**Important:**
- Phone number + country code and the rest
- It will be better if you choose square photos
